## Project 2: Simple Grep

You will write a simple replacement for the Unix "grep" utility

Grep reads a file (or standard input, if there is no file) and returns lines that meet a specific search criteria. It can read one or more files.

Usage: 

    ./mygrep.py spam myfile.txt

* Stage 1:
  * Simple string searches
  * Single file or standard in, depending on command line arguments
* Stage 2:
  * Add regular expression search
  * Add –v command line option (show lines not containing search)
* Stage 3:
  * Add –i (ignore case) command line option
  * Add –F (simple string match, fgrep equivalent) command line option
* Stage 4:
  * Add additional command line arguments / functionality from grep
  * You choose what to add!
