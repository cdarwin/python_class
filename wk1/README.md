# Python â€“ Week 1 Projects

These two projects constitute the lab work for week 1 of the Taos Python class. They are designed to be  quite doable during the 2-hour lab time, as long as you have viewed the lectures beforehand.

All completed work should be submitted via Moodle. Do not email, print, or send via carrier pigeon.
